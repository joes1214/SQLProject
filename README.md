## Sql Project
Using C# and ASP.NET I created a small project that shows my usage of programming in C# and SQL Queries.
The project:

 - Connects to a Database
 - Inserts to the Database
 - Retrieves from the Database

**Important to note that the database was stored locally and the `id` column updates incrementally.**
